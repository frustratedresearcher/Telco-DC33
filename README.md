## **üîç MalSim ‚Äì Building Covert Telecom Trackers with Malicious eSIM Profiles**

This talk explores how **malicious eSIM profiles** can be leveraged for persistent telecom surveillance and covert tracking in modern mobile ecosystems.

**Key Highlights**:  
- Deep dive into **eSIM architecture** and Android API surfaces.  
- Attack workflow for **silent malicious profile provisioning**.  
- Low-level **APDU exploitation** for metadata harvesting.  
- Privilege escalation, persistence, and anti-forensics techniques.  
- Detection and defense strategies for operators and OEMs.

## **üì° WAPDropper ‚Äì Telecom Billing Exploitation**

A case study on how **WAPDropper malware** silently exploits **Direct Carrier Billing (DCB)** systems to subscribe users to premium services without their knowledge.

**Key Highlights**:  
- Evolution from SMS-based fraud to **DCB/WAP exploitation**.  
- Infection chain and **modular dropper architecture**.  
- Advanced techniques like **hidden WebView billing**, **header manipulation**, and **CAPTCHA bypass** using ML APIs.  
- Mitigation strategies for carriers, aggregators, and regulators.
